        <p>I am a 12 year boy, who likes to code HTML, CSS and JS. I study in Podar International School.

        I was born in Bihar in Kahalgoan, at my late-grandfathers place. I lived a few years in Jamshedpur, 
        then we moved to Mumbai. Those three years went through like nothing! I found ourselves moving again.

        I don't remember much from my early life, but thanks to pictures and videos, I know at least a little. 
        My parents keep telling me that I didn't start speaking until when I was 2 or 3 years old.
        I had a lot of curly hair, and loved to have baths in buckets (I didn't remember that one ðŸ˜…)
        My parents would keep calling out my name, but I just wouldn't listen, or give any indication that I could hear them.
        That got my parents worried, so they thought there was some  problem with my ears! But, after a few suggestions from my
        Mom's cousins, Mom and Dad decided to send me to school. And voila! I started to speak (sort of)

            After moving from Jamshedpur to Mumbai, we were staying at a building named Paradise. It had quite
            a lot of wings from "A" to "E". I had a lot of friends there. We all went down and played football 
            in the evening. Also, I started studying in Podar International School Senior Kg. and was about to 
            go up to first grade! I was qute excited for that. After a few short years, we had to move again.

            Now, we are staying in Thane, where I am still going to Podar School, and am in 7th grade. I love Python 
            (because its super easy). Because of the Covid pandemic, we aren't really going to school. We are having online
            schools, so we dont have to go out. Ultimately, online school has its pros and cons which I won't go into right now
            but its still a lot of fun.
